## Description

The Regression Tree Visual is an interactive tool that helps visualize Americans' political beliefs and values based on their personal identity. The visual uses data from the World Values Survey to show how identity can impact political values. To use the visualization, click on the black dots to expand and shrink the tree. When the dot is clicked, the most important variable for the subset will be highlighted. Clicking on the graph dots will then expand the tree. The visualization explains how different aspects of people's identity can affect their political values. With this information, users can better understand how their identity may shape or influence their beliefs and values.

## How To Use

## Project Status

The tree visualization and the backend API to construct trees are completed. Now I need to create a visual to query the API to visualize different types of data.
